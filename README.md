A powerful shell script that helps you manage outdated Homebrew formulae by generating detailed Markdown reports with release notes from GitHub.

## ✨ Features

- **Smart Formula Detection**: Automatically identifies outdated Homebrew formulae
- **Interactive Management**: Use `gum` for beautiful CLI interactions to manage ignored packages
- **GitHub Integration**: Fetches release notes directly from GitHub repositories
- **Markdown Reports**: Generates professional release notes in Markdown format
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple formulae efficiently
- **Timestamped Output**: Organized reports with readable timestamps
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and informative warnings

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following tools installed:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
brew install gh jq gum

# Authenticate GitHub CLI (required for fetching release notes)
gh auth login
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HubertReX/brew_check_before_upgrade.git
   cd brew_check_before_upgrade
   ```

2. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x brew-release_notes.sh
   ```

### Usage

Run the script to check for outdated formulae and generate reports:

```bash
./brew-release_notes.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check for outdated Homebrew formulae
2. Allow you to interactively select which formulae to ignore
3. Generate detailed Markdown reports for the remaining formulae
4. Save reports in a timestamped directory (e.g., `reports_2025-01-22_14:30:45/`)

## 📖 How It Works

### Workflow

1. **Dependency Check**: Verifies all required tools are installed
2. **Outdated Detection**: Uses `brew outdated --json` to find packages needing updates
3. **Interactive Filtering**: Uses `gum choose` for selecting packages to ignore
4. **Repository Discovery**: Extracts GitHub repository paths from brew formula metadata
5. **Release Notes Fetching**: Uses `gh release` commands to get version history
6. **Report Generation**: Creates timestamped Markdown reports in organized directories

### File Structure

```
brew_check_upgrade/
├── brew-release_notes.sh      # Main script
├── get_release_notes_from_gh.sh # Utility script for GitHub release notes
├── ignored_formulae.txt       # List of formulae to skip (auto-generated)
├── reports_YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS/ # Generated reports directory
│   ├── formula1_from_1.0.0.md
│   ├── formula2_from_2.1.0.md
│   └── ...
├── CLAUDE.md                  # Development guidelines
└── README.md                  # This file
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Ignored Formulae

The script maintains an `ignored_formulae.txt` file to track packages you want to skip. You can:

- **Interactive Selection**: Choose formulae to ignore during script execution
- **Manual Editing**: Edit `ignored_formulae.txt` directly to add/remove formulae
- **Automatic Sorting**: The file is automatically sorted and deduplicated

### GitHub API Limits

The script fetches the **last 50 releases** for each repository to balance between comprehensive coverage and performance. This limit can be adjusted in the script if needed.
